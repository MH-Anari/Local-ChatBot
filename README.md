## Potential Issues & Troubleshooting

*   **Ollama Not Found:**  Ensure Ollama is installed correctly and accessible in your system's PATH.  Verify Ollama is running.
*   **Download Errors:** If you encounter errors during the model download, check your internet connection and available disk space.  Try clearing your Ollama cache: `ollama cache clean`.
*   **Resource Constraints:** Running large language models requires significant computational resources (CPU, RAM, GPU).  If you experience performance issues or errors, try using a smaller model of gemma3 or another.
*   **Model Version Conflicts:**  Make sure the model name used in the notebook (`gemma3:12b`) matches the version you have pulled with Ollama.
