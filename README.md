# Gemma 3.12B Local LLM with Ollama - Jupyter Notebook

This Jupyter Notebook allows you to easily run the Gemma 3.12B large language model locally using Ollama.  It's a convenient way to experiment with this powerful model without relying on external APIs.

## Prerequisites

*   **Ollama:**  You *must* have Ollama installed on your system.  Download it from [https://ollama.com/](https://ollama.com/).
*   **Python 3.8+:**  Ensure you have a compatible Python version.
*   **Git:** For cloning the repository.

## Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [Your GitHub Repository URL]
    cd [Your Repository Directory]
    ```

2.  **Pull Gemma 3.12B (if not already pulled):**  The notebook automatically attempts to pull Gemma 3.12B upon execution.  You can also manually pull it using Ollama before running the notebook:
    ```bash
    ollama pull gemma:3.12b
    ```
    *Note:  This download can take a significant amount of time and disk space (approximately 16GB).*

3.  **Open the Jupyter Notebook:**
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```
    or
    ```bash
    jupyter lab
    ```
    Navigate to and open the `Gemma_LLM_with_Ollama.ipynb` file.

## Usage

1.  **Review the Notebook:**  The notebook is structured with clear instructions and commented code blocks. Read the instructions in each cell before execution.
2.  **Run the Cells:** Execute the cells sequentially to pull the model (if needed), configure the Ollama environment, and interact with Gemma.
3.  **Experiment!:** Modify the prompts and parameters in the notebook to explore the capabilities of the model.

## Potential Issues & Troubleshooting

*   **Ollama Not Found:**  Ensure Ollama is installed correctly and accessible in your system's PATH.  Verify Ollama is running.
*   **Download Errors:** If you encounter errors during the model download, check your internet connection and available disk space.  Try clearing your Ollama cache: `ollama cache clean`.
*   **Resource Constraints:** Running large language models requires significant computational resources (CPU, RAM, GPU).  If you experience performance issues or errors, try reducing the batch size or using a smaller model.
*   **GPU Usage:** While Gemma can run on CPU, using a GPU significantly improves performance. Ensure your GPU drivers are up-to-date and that your environment is configured to utilize the GPU (e.g., setting `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` if necessary - though normally Ollama handles this).
*   **Model Version Conflicts:**  Make sure the model name used in the notebook (`gemma:3.12b`) matches the version you have pulled with Ollama.
